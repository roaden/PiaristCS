This is an example file for how to add things to a git repository.

I'm reminding myself that I want to type (in the base directory, or at least the directory where changes were made):

git add .

to add the files that were changed.

Then I have to commit my changes by typing:

git commit -m "A description of the changes made."

Then, to get them onto the website, I need to type

git push

Now, as long as I'm in the directory with a git repository, this should all work out juuuuust fine!
