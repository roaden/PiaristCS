Implement a Caesar cypher.  This is the sort of thing I'm looking for.

Minimum success:
1.) Something that takes a lowercase word and shifts all the letters 13 letters forward (or backward) in the alphabet. (20 pts)

Getting better:
2.) Include uppercase letters too!  (20 pts)

And wouldn't it be nice if ...
3.) The cypher didn't touch anything that wasn't a letter in the string, so I could (de)cypher all sorts of phrases! (20 pts)

Better still:
4.) Make it happen inside a loop, so that I can keep cyphering / decyphering. (20 pts)

Ideally:
5.) Have that loop exit when some exit word is typed.  Make sure to print out what that is when the program starts! (20 pts)


This one's a bit more involved, so, make good use of your snow days!

Here's the sample output that I got when I ran the program.

(The $ represents being at the prompt.)


$ python3 caesar.py
Type what you want Caesar to obfuscate, or type quit to exit!
