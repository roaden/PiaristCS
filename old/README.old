# PiaristCS

Welcome to the Piarist Computer Science course!

Week 1:

Instructions for using git:

To add all the work you've done (must be in directory of repository):

git add .

To commit the changes, type:

git commit -m "A description of the changes."

To push it to the server:

git push


Week 0:

Make a github account.  Make a scratch account.  Make a slack account. Have some way to access bash, or be willing to teach yourself how to do everything I show you in your own way.  (The linux subsystem for Windows works great for that, and that's what I use at home for my own projects.)

Watch the video for week 0 in the Harvard CS-50 course.  You can skip over the bit about introducing the teaching assistants for the course--we don't know them--but certainly watch the bit afterward about scratch.  Because, your first assignment is:

Program something in Scratch, to present to the class on Tuesday!  It must use the concepts introduced in the CS50 lecture.  It can be a game, a quiz, anything at all really, as long as it's interesting.  You have to include at least one variable, read user input, and make a sprite DO something.  The points you earn for the assignment will be based on:

Does the program run?  Does it do what it's supposed to do?  20 points.  Also, none of the rest of the points are possible if this isn't true!  Make sure you have a working program!

Does the program include everything?  20 points.

Style--Does it look cool, or does it look kind of ... not?  Does your sprite only turn around if it's upside down?  The little things matter!  20 points.

Uniqueness.  Sure, you could implement something exactly like you saw David make, but making something new and different is cooler.  20 points.

Fun.  Is it interesting or boring?  Do we all want to play it again, or is one time enough?  20 points for your interesting program!
